## About

This is a software engineering team generator command line application. This application app runs as a Node CLI to gather 

information about each employee. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 

Includes testing to ensure that all unit tests pass. When the user has completed 

building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information 

provided by the user.
